This repository contains lab assignments designed to explore object-oriented programming, recursion, analysis of algorithms, and data structures such as vectors, queues, stacks, lists, trees, and graphs. Written in C++, the lab assignments correspond with the following tasks:

1. lab_01 - Getting started with C++
2. lab_02 - Working with vectors
3. lab_03 - Implement a linked list
4. lab_04 - Sequential Search
5. lab_05 - Implement insertion sort
6. lab_06 - Comparing sorting algorithms
7. lab_07 - Implement binary search
8. lab_08 - Implement a binary tree
9. lab_09 - Implement a binary search tree
10. lab_10 - Implement a queue
11. lab_11 - Implement a stack
12. lab_12 - Implement a hash table
